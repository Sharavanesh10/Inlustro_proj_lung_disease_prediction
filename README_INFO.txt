PROBLEM STATEMENT:
------------------
Predicting lung diseases is an important area in medical research and healthcare. Here's an outline of the content you might consider when working on lung disease prediction using modules and packages:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
----------------------------------
Gathering datasets containing medical images (e.g., X-rays, CT scans) of lungs with labeled disease conditions.
Preprocessing the data, which may include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and handling missing data.

Feature Extraction and Selection:
---------------------------------
Extracting relevant features from the medical images that can help in distinguishing between different lung diseases.
Selecting important features to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.

Model Selection and Training:
-----------------------------
Choosing appropriate machine learning or deep learning models for lung disease prediction, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Training the selected model using the training data and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Evaluation:
-----------
Evaluating the trained model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizing evaluation results to gain insights into model performance and areas for improvement.

Deployment and Integration:
---------------------------
Deploying the trained model into production environments for real-time inference.
Integrating the model with existing healthcare systems or applications to assist medical professionals in diagnosing lung diseases.

Package and Module Organization:
--------------------------------
Organizing your code into reusable modules and packages for better maintainability and scalability.
Creating separate modules for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
Using popular Python packages such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras for different aspects of the project.

Documentation and Testing:
--------------------------
Documenting your code, including function docstrings, module-level documentation, and usage examples.
Writing unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual modules and functions.
Conducting integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality of the entire system.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
----------------------------------------------
Setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deploying your lung disease prediction system.
Leveraging continuous integration tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

Data Preparation: Loads images from directories using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory(). It also prints out the counts of images in the training and test datasets.

Data Visualization: Displays sample images from the training dataset for each category using Matplotlib.

Model Training:

Two CNN models (model1 and model2) are built and trained.
Data augmentation is applied to model2 using techniques like random flipping, rotation, and zooming.
Another model (model3) is built using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 as the base model.
The training progress and performance metrics (accuracy and loss) are plotted.
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using the test dataset, and classification reports are generated to assess their performance.

Additional Model: DenseNet121 is used as another base model for transfer learning, and a model (model4) is built on top of it.
